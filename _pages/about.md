Bio
======
I am currently a (pre-)Post Doc researcher in the Risk and Reliability research group at the Department of the Build Environment, Aalborg University (Denmark). I recently handed in my PhD thesis, and I am currently awaiting the preliminary assessment of the assessment committee, thus the labeling as (pre-)Post Doc researcher. I hold a MSc degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering from Aarhus University (Denmark) with specialization in structural analysis and monitoring of structures, and a BSc degree in Civil and Structural Engineering from Aarhus University with a specialization in structural analysis. I have worked as an engineer at Niras (Denmark), COWI (Denmark), and Per Aarsleff (Denmark), where I was mainly involved in design and assessments of geotechnical support structural and marine structures. As may be apparent, I was born and raised in Denmark.

My current research interests evolve around the modeling and analysis of complex systems, as well as the integration of the modeling efforts into the overarching decision context, the modeling aims to serve.
