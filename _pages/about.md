Short bio
====
Sebastian Tølbøll Glavind is a postdoctoral researcher in the Section of Civil Engineering and Construction Management, Department of the Built Environment, Aalborg University (Denmark), and he is further working as a consultant for the company NORTH consulting. Sebastian holds a PhD degree in Engineering from Aalborg University (Denmark), where he focused on developing and analyzing probabilistic machine learning models for decision support, a MSc degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering from Aarhus University (Denmark) with specializations in structural analysis and monitoring of structures, and a BSc degree in Civil and Structural Engineering from Aarhus University with a specialization in structural analysis. He has practiced engineering at NIRAS (Denmark), COWI (Denmark), and Per Aarsleff (Denmark), where he was mainly involved in design and assessments of geotechnical support structures and marine structures.

Sebastians research interests evolve around the probabilistic modeling and analysis of complex systems, as well as the integration of the modeling efforts into the overarching decision context, which the modeling aims to support. In this regard, he mainly works with Bayesian approaches in statistics, machine learning, and decision analysis.  

Research projects
====
Sebastian is and have been actively involved in a wide range of research projects, some of which are listed below with brief descriptions.

**Ongoing projects** 

* *Discrepancy modeling*: 
This project is undertaken jointly with Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark (DTU Mechanical Engineering) and has until now mainly focused on discrepancy modeling related to Morrison’s equation based on measurements of forces on a cylindrical body under different turbulence intensities, but the project is just getting started, and more interesting work will follow.

* *InnoSHM*: 
InnoSHM is an acronym for Innovative Structural Health Monitoring and risk-informed structural integrity management. This project in undertaken jointly with, among others, industrial partners TOTAL E&P Denmark and RAMBØLL Denmark, and DTU Civil Engineering. The project focuses on devising a structural health monitoring campaign for offshore structures, where special attention is given to damage feature design, e.g., identification of potential indicators for different failures in offshore structures, feature selection, and data fusion and normalization.

* *VALID*: 
VALID is an acronym for Verification through Accelerated testing Loading to Improved wave energy Designs. This project in undertaken jointly with, among others, industrial partners WAVEPISTON, AQUATERA, and CORPOWER OCEAN AB, and Technical University of Delft, Netherlands. The main objective of the project is to de-risk the wave energy converter (WEC) design process, in terms of reliability and survivability, through development and validation of a new platform (and associated techniques) for accelerated hybrid testing of critical components and subsystems that can be used across the entire wave energy sector.           

* *Corrosion and fatigue of offshore structures*: 
This project is undertaken jointly with industrial partner TOTAL E&P Denmark, and several departments at DTU, i.e., DTU Civil Engineering, DTU Mechanical Engineering, DTU Wind Energy. The purpose of the project is to provide insight on the fatigue performance of modern materials, welds, and structures for offshore applications and, through model development and a general reduction of model uncertainties, to enable more reliable and cost-efficient fatigue design, maintenance, and repair.

* *Structural health management for offshore wind turbine farms (knowledge transfer project; Energy Cluster Denmark)*: 
This project is undertaken jointly with industrial partners LIC Engineering, Vattenfall Vindkraft, and MATRISK Gmbh, and the Danish Center for Risk and Safety Management, Aalborg University. The purpose of the project is the knowledge transfer of present best practice on risk-informed inspection and maintenance planning, and digital twin technology from the offshore oil and gas industry to the offshore wind industry.

**Selected, completed projects**

* *Information-consistent systems modeling and analysis - with applications in offshore engineering*, PhD thesis, Aalborg University, 2021.
* *Vibration-based identification of mass changes using statistical learning theory*, MSc thesis, Aarhus University, 2016.
