Bio
======
I am currently a (pre-)Post Doc researcher in the Risk and Reliability research group at the Department of the Build Environment, Aalborg University (Denmark). I recently handed in my PhD thesis, and I am currently awaiting the preliminary assessment of the assessment committee, thus the labeling as (pre-)Post Doc researcher. I hold a MSc degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering from Aarhus University (Denmark) with specialization in structural analysis and monitoring of structures, and a BSc degree in Civil and Structural Engineering from Aarhus University with a specialization in structural analysis. I have worked as an engineer at Niras (Denmark), COWI (Denmark), and Per Aarsleff (Denmark), where I was mainly involved in design and assessments of geotechnical support structural and marine structures. As may be apparent, I was born and raised in Denmark.

My current research interests evolve around the modeling and analysis of complex systems, as well as the integration of the modeling efforts into the overarching decision context, the modeling aims to serve.   

Research projects
======

I am and have be actively involved in a wide range of research projects, which appear below with brief descriptions.

Ongoing projects 
---
* **Discrepancy modeling**: 
This project is undertaken jointly with Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark and has until now mainly focused on discrepancy modeling related to Morrisonâ€™s equation based on measurements of forces on a cylindrical body under different turbulence intensities, but we are just getting started and more interesting work will follow.

* **InnoSHM**: 
This project in undertaken jointly with, among others, industrial partners Total E&P Denmark and Ramboll, and Department of Civil Engineering, Technical University of Denmark. The project focuses on devising a structural health monitoring campaign for offshore structures, where special attention is given to damage feature design, e.g., identification of potential indicators for different failures in offshore structures, feature selection, and data fusion and normalization.

* **VALID**: 
Coming soon
* **Corrosion and Fatigue of Offshore Structures**: 
Coming soon

* **Knowledge transfer project (Energy cluster)**: 
Coming soon
