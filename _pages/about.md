Short biography
====
Sebastian Tølbøll Glavind is a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of the Built Environment, Aalborg University (Denmark), and he is further working as a consultant for the company NORTH consulting (CVR 14294481). Sebastian holds a PhD degree in Engineering from Aalborg University (Denmark), where he developed and analyzed probabilistic machine learning models for decision support; a MSc degree in Civil and Architectural Engineering from Aarhus University (Denmark) with specializations in structural analysis and monitoring of structures; and a BSc degree in Civil and Structural Engineering from Aarhus University with a specialization in structural analysis. He has practiced engineering at NIRAS (Denmark), COWI (Denmark), and Per Aarsleff (Denmark), where he was mainly involved in design and assessments of geotechnical support structures and marine structures.

Sebastians research interests evolve around the probabilistic modeling and analysis of complex systems, as well as the integration of the modeling efforts into the overarching decision context, which the modeling aims to support. In this regard, he mainly works with Bayesian approaches in statistics, machine learning, and decision analysis.  

Research projects
====
Sebastian is and have been actively involved in a wide range of research projects, some of which are listed below with brief descriptions.

**Ongoing projects** 

* *InnoSHM*: 
Innovative Structural Health Monitoring and risk-informed structural integrity management (InnoSHM) is a joint project between TotalEnergies Denmark, RAMBØLL Denmark, Brincker Monitoring, DTU Civil Engineering, and AAU Build. The project focuses on devising a structural health monitoring campaign for offshore structures, where special attention is given to damage feature design, e.g., identification of potential indicators for different failures in offshore structures, feature selection, and data fusion and normalization.         

* *Corrosion and fatigue of offshore structures*: 
This project is undertaken jointly by TotalEnergies Denmark, several departments at DTU, i.e., Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Wind Energy, and AAU Build. The purpose of the project is to provide insight on the fatigue performance of modern materials, welds, and structures for offshore applications and, through model development and a general reduction of model uncertainties, to enable more reliable and cost-efficient fatigue design, maintenance, and repair.

* *STROWIN*: 
Reliability-based structural health monitoring in offshore wind (STROWIN) is a joint project between LIC Engineering, MATRISK Gmbh, and AAU Build. The aim of the project is to make offshore wind-energy production more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective through the use of four key technologies, namely, risk-based inspection planning, building interface modelling, structural health monitoring and digital twins. This will enable (i) a reduction of operational risks by reducing the cost of inspections, (ii) decision support at end of the Life, which facilitates life-time extensions, and (iii) future design improvements based on feedback from the developed software tool (end product).

* *Discrepancy modeling*: 
This project is undertaken jointly by Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and Department of the Built Environment (Build), Aalborg University (AAU), and it has until now mainly focused on discrepancy modeling related to Morrison’s equation based on measurements of forces on a cylindrical body under different turbulence intensities, but the project is just getting started, and more interesting work will follow.

* *VALID*: 
Verification through Accelerated testing Loading to Improved wave energy Designs (VALID) is a joint project between, among others, WAVEPISTON, AQUATERA, and CORPOWER OCEAN AB, Technical University of Delft, and AAU Build. The main objective of the project is to de-risk the wave energy converter (WEC) design process, in terms of reliability and survivability, through development and validation of a new platform (and associated techniques) for accelerated hybrid testing of critical components and subsystems that can be used across the entire wave energy sector.  

**Selected, completed projects**

* *Structural health management for offshore wind turbine farms (knowledge transfer project for Energy Cluster Denmark)*, LIC Engineering, Vattenfall Vindkraft, MATRISK Gmbh, and Aalborg University, 2021. 

* *Information-consistent systems modeling and analysis - with applications in offshore engineering*, PhD thesis, Aalborg University, 2021.

* *Vibration-based identification of mass changes using statistical learning theory*, MSc thesis, Aarhus University, 2016.
