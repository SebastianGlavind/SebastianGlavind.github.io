I have a master's degree in civil and structural engineering, and I dedicated the last year of my MSc study, including my MSc thesis, to vibration-based damage detection using machine learning (ML). At that time, I was working together with the Monitoring of Structures research group at Aarhus University, who wanted to apply their structural health monitoring technologies within a probabilistic framework to perform damage detection. I had a solid background in applied mathematics and a semi-solid background in statistics, but machine learning was a completely new field to me. As most people would probably do, I stated out by finding some book recommendations on the topic, collected to most highly rated books, i.e., Bishop (2006) and Murphy (2012), and dived in. These books are somewhat of a mouthful when you are not familiar with the ML jargon and workflow, but then I found Andrew Ngâ€™s original Stanford/Coursera.org course, which became a game changer for me, and I now have a PhD in probabilistic modeling and analysis (ML) and work as a Postdoc in this field.

So, to help others break into ML as well, I have put together a progression outline that I would follow if I had to do it all over again in 2022. One thing to note here is that you need to have a solid foundation in the underlaying basis, i.e., mathematics and programming, to fully understand and confidently apply ML technologies in practice. Therefore, this outline will not only focus on building you knowledge on the core ML topics but also on the basis.
