I have a master's degree in civil and structural engineering, wherein I dedicated the last year, including my MSc thesis, to vibration-based damage detection using machine learning (ML). At that time, I was working together with the Monitoring of Structures research group at Aalborg University, who wanted to apply their structural health monitoring technologies within a probabilistic framework to perform damage detection. I had a solid background in applied mathematics and a semi-solid background in statistics, but machine learning was a completely new field to me. As most people would probably do, I stated out by finding some book recommendations on the topic, collected to most highly rated books, i.e., Bishop (2009) and Murphy (2012), and dived in. â€¦
